The **Warsaw Public Transport Dashboard** is an interactive data visualization project that streams real-time information about public transport buses and trams in Warsaw. It provides a live view of bus and tram locations, as well as detailed route information. This README serves as a guide to set up and run the project, whether you want to use Kafka for local development or leverage Google Pub/Sub for production deployment.

## Overview

The project gathers data from [https://api.um.warszawa.pl/](https://api.um.warszawa.pl/) to capture real-time information about the location of public transport buses and trams in Warsaw. It offers the following key features:

- Real-time tracking of bus and tram locations.
- Visualization of bus and tram routes.
- Interactive dashboard for exploring public transport data.

## Local Development with Kafka

If you want to run this project locally using Kafka for data streaming, follow the steps outlined in the [Local Development Setup](/local-setup.md) section. This section will guide you through the installation of necessary components, running Kafka, and configuring the project to consume data from the Kafka topic.

## Production Deployment with Google Pub/Sub

For production deployment or if you want to leverage the capabilities of Google Pub/Sub for data streaming, refer to the [Production Deployment Guide](/production-deployment.md). This guide will walk you through setting up a Google Cloud project, creating a Pub/Sub topic, and configuring your project to publish and consume data using Google Pub/Sub.

## Generating Tram and Bus Routes / Bus Stops

In addition to real-time tracking, this project also offers functionality to capture and draw tram and bus routes from the gathered data. To draw routes and get bus stops localisation explore [creating_routes_with_bus_stops](/creating_routes_with_bus_stops)
